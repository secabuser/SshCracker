## How to Use

### Linux
#### Step 1: Install Prerequisites
1. Verify Python 3.x is installed:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
2. If Python isnâ€™t installed, use the following commands to install:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```
3. Install necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip3 install paramiko pystyle colorama
   ```

#### Step 2: Prepare Input Files
- **IP File**: Contains IP addresses and ports in `<IP>:<Port>` format. Example:
  ```
  192.168.1.1:22
  192.168.1.2:22
  ```
- **Username File**: Contains a list of usernames, one per line. Example:
  ```
  admin
  root
  ```
- **Password File**: Contains a list of passwords, one per line. Example:
  ```
  password123
  admin@123
  ```

#### Step 3: Run the Script
- Execute the script:
  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```

#### Step 4: Follow the Prompts
The script will ask for:
1. Path to the IP file.
2. Path to the username file.
3. Path to the password file.
4. Maximum number of threads.

#### Step 5: Check Results
After completion, view the generated log files:
- `good.txt`: Records successful connections.

Use commands like `cat` to check logs:
```bash
cat good.txt
```

### Additional Notes
1. **Log Management**:
   - Logs are cleared at the start of each execution to avoid duplication.
2. **Terminal Optimization**:
   - The script clears the terminal after inputs are provided and reprints the banner for a clean interface.
3. **Compatibility**:
   - Works on both Linux and Windows systems.
